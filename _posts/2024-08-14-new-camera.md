I’m excited to share that I recently upgraded my gear with a Sony a6100 — a fantastic mirrorless camera that’s become a game changer for my football YouTube channel and video editing workflow.

### Why the Sony a6100?

The Sony a6100 offers a perfect balance of portability, image quality, and powerful video features that are ideal for content creation focused on sports like football. With its excellent autofocus system and crisp 4K video capabilities, it lets me capture the action on the pitch with impressive detail and smoothness. I also means I can engage in more photography and make better thumbnails.

### Shooting Football Videos

Using the a6100, I’ve been able to record high-quality footage for my channel. The camera’s fast autofocus keeps players sharp in frame even during fast-paced moments, which is essential for football content where every movement counts. Had some trouble with ISO and lighting but managed to make it work without professional lighting gear.

### Editing Workflow

After filming, I dive into my editing setup where I bring everything together. The footage from the a6100 integrates seamlessly with premiere pro, allowing me to create dynamic, engaging videos that showcase the sport’s excitement and strategy. Whether it’s cutting together highlight reels or adding tactical graphics, the combination of great footage and precise editing helps me deliver compelling content to my audience.
