## Liverpoolâ€™s Silent January: A Missed Opportunity?

Another window goes by without Liverpool signing anyone and I can't help but feel the red's will come to regret this come the end of the season.

With Liverpool being thoroughly in the title race this window offered Liverpool a unique opportunity to strengthen and show some intent. Robertson whilst being a club legend has not been at his best and looks in need of support given an out of favour Tsimikas. Furthermore, Salah needs help. Salah cannot have a bad game in this team, the other forward players are too inconsistent to pick up the slack despite having some decent purple patches and this window could have aided this.

Its frustrating becauase there is a chance that Liverpool won't be in this position again for a long time and they haven't taken the opportunity to strengthen.
