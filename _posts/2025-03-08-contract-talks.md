## Stalled Talks, Big Names: What’s Going On with Salah and Van Dijk?

As Arne Slot begins his reign at Liverpool, the club finds itself in an all-too-familiar position: uncertainty surrounding key players. With both **Mohamed Salah** and **Virgil van Dijk** entering the final year of their contracts, fans are left wondering — why haven’t deals been done yet?

Slot inherits a team in transition, but without clarity on the futures of its most iconic figures, it’s a rocky start to a new era.

### A Rebuild Without Foundations?

Let’s be clear: Salah and Van Dijk are more than just names on a teamsheet. They are Liverpool’s identity — the two standout figures of the Klopp era. Losing them, or allowing their exits to drag on without resolution, would be a huge blow not just on the pitch, but psychologically throughout the club.

The silence around new deals is growing louder. Both players have made ambiguous comments about their futures, and the club hasn’t been proactive in communicating its stance. Are they waiting to see how Slot settles? If so, they may already be too late.

### Lessons Not Learned

Liverpool has a history of letting major contracts run down. **Wijnaldum**, **Mané**, and **Firmino** all left with a sense of "what if?" — either for free or well below their value. Now it’s happening again, only this time it’s the two players who arguably defined the club’s peak under Klopp.

Salah, who attracted huge offers from Saudi Arabia last year, could walk for free next summer. And Van Dijk, the club captain and defensive rock, has hinted at needing to assess the direction of the club post-Klopp — a direction that’s still murky at best.

### Slot Needs Certainty

For **Arne Slot**, this is not an ideal way to begin his Liverpool tenure. Starting fresh is already a massive challenge, but doing it with a backdrop of contract sagas makes it even harder. 

Slot needs leaders in the dressing room — not players with one eye on the exit. If Salah and Van Dijk are staying, the club must get them locked down quickly. If not, clarity is needed so replacements can be lined up.

The longer this limbo continues, the more damage it does to what should be a period of renewal.

### A Defining Summer

Liverpool can’t afford to be passive this summer. With a new manager, a new backroom staff, and fans eager to see the club evolve, they must avoid letting this situation become another avoidable PR and footballing mess.

Whether Salah and Van Dijk stay or go, Liverpool need to take control of the narrative — and fast.

Letting two legends slip away without a plan would be a bitter way to start the post-Klopp era.
