## Part Time Remote Work

It was an absolute pleasure to collaborate with the team at Anything Liverpool, creating short-form videos tailored specifically for their TikTok audience. Working remotely, I was able to bring fresh ideas and energy to their content, helping to boost views and interactions significantly over a short period.

Some of the key challenges we faced and overcame together included:  

* **Retaining viewer attention within the first few seconds:** In the fast-paced world of TikTok, grabbing attention immediately is crucial. I focused on sharp, eye-catching edits and hooks to maximize engagement.
* **SEO optimisation:** Optimizing video titles, descriptions, and hashtags helped improve discoverability on the platform, increasing organic reach.
* **Pacing and storytelling:** Crafting compelling narratives within very short timeframes required careful planning and creative editing to keep content engaging and meaningful.
* **Creative collaboration:** Working closely with the Anything Liverpool team to align creative vision and iterate quickly based on feedback was essential for success.

Through this role, I strengthened my ability to produce impactful football content that resonates with fans and drives engagement across social media platforms.

This opportunity not only sharpened my video editing skills but also deepened my understanding of audience engagement in the football community. I look forward to applying these experiences in future roles where football and video editing intersect.
