Hello, my name is Olly Evans. I am currently in my third year of studying Electronic Engineering, with a strong focus on the intersection of technology, media, and innovation. Alongside my academic pursuits, I have developed a keen interest in video editing and digital content creation, which allows me to apply both my technical knowledge and creative skills.

This website serves as a platform where I document and share my insights on a variety of subjects including football, video editing, and advancements in artificial intelligence. Through my blog posts, I aim to provide thoughtful analysis, practical advice, and engaging discussions relevant to both hobbyists and professionals alike on football, editing and AI topics.
